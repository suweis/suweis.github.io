I obtained both my bachelor’s and master’s degrees in Theoretical Physics from the University of Padova. My final master’s thesis was a theoretical investigation of a subject between statistical physics and ecological systems, performed under the guidance of Prof. Amos Maritan. Soon after graduating, I started a Ph.D. program in Environmental Engineering at the Ecole Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL), in Switzerland, under the supervision of Prof. Andrea Rinaldo. During my graduate studies, I spent almost one year at Princeton University working with Prof. I.R. Iturbe on the analysis and modelling of Virtual Water trade networks. I then returned to the University of Padova to pursue postdoctoral work studying ecological networks and dynamics. In 2016 I became Assistant Professor in the Physics and Astronomy Department at the University of Padova, and since then I expanded my research also working on Computational Neuroscience and Whole brain models at the newborn [Padova Neuroscience Center] (www.pnc.unipd.it). I’m also affiliated with the [European Center of Living Technology in Venice] (https://www.unive.it/pag/23664/), where every year I organize schools or workshops.

I have been Associate Professor in Padova since 2022, being one of the Principal Investigator at [LIPh] (https://www.liphlab.com/), the collaborative Laboratory of Interdisciplinary Physics together with Prof. Amos Maritan and Prof. Sandro Azaele.
